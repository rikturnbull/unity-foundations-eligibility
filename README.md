## Unity Noughts and Crosses

A Unity implementation of Noughts and Crosses (Tic Tac Toe). This program plays in Easy mode, that is random and Hard mode, that uses the minimax algorithm as described here: [Tic Tac Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm â€” Never Stop Building - Crafting Wood with Japanese Techniques](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax).

This is based on the XR Foundations eligibility test and is coded with the following principals in mind (which might not apply in real life):

- Do make it work
- Do not rewrite the supplied sample framework
- Do not obsessively refactor, stick to the supplied classes
- Do resist the temptation to turn it into a First Person Shooter
- Do re-use the data structures as supplied
- Do optimize for speed, memory and smaller program size over readability but don't go too far
