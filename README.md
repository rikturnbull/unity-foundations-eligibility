## Unity Noughts and Crosses

A Unity implementation of Noughts and Crosses (Tic Tac Toe). This program plays in a random Easy mode and a Hard mode that uses the minimax algorithm as described here: [Tic Tac Toe: Understanding the Minimax Algorithm](https://www.neverstopbuilding.com/blog/minimax).

This is coded for the XR Foundations eligibility test. Generally, I didn't want to go too far from the sample framework classes and data structures. I played around with some speed and memory optimizations.
